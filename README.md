# readmefetch

**readmefetch** This GitHub Workflow script, written in Python, automatically generates a neofetch-like README based on your GitHub account stats :D

## üöÄ Setup

### 1. Repository Setup
1. **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account.
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Rename the forked repository to match your GitHub username exactly. 
   - **If you want this to appear on your profile of course - you can name it whatever you want to just check it out, but if you want the fetch to appear on your profile, it has to match your username**
   - Example: `username/username`

### 2. Create a GitHub Token

**Why is this necessary? -> Because the Python Script uses PyGithub which rate limits requests with no tokens to 60 Requests/ Hour and with a Token to 5000 Requests / Hour. Without a Token, the rate limit will be hit really quickly and this script won't work (trust me I tried)**

1. Go to [GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer Settings ‚Üí Personal Access Tokens ‚Üí Tokens (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
2. Click **"Generate new token (classic)"**.
3. **Name**: `ReadmeFetch Token` (or any name you prefer).
4. **Expiration**: Choose as needed (recommended: never expire).
5. **Select scopes**:
   - ‚úÖ `workflow`
6. Click **"Generate"**.
7. üìù **COPY THE TOKEN** - You won't see it again!

### 3. Configure the Repository
1. Go to your fork's **"Settings" ‚Üí "Secrets and variables" ‚Üí "Actions"**.
2. Create a new repository secret:
   - **Name**: `GH_TOKEN`
   - **Value**: Your copied token

### 4. Enable Actions
1. Go to the **"Actions"** tab.
2. Click **"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"**.
3. On the left sidebar, go to **"Start Workflow"**.
4. A message saying something like **"This scheduled workflow is disabled because scheduled workflows are disabled by default in forks."** should appear.
   - **This is because I disabled the script, otherwise it would always run on this repo and remove the instructions (if anyone knows a better solution, lmk!)**
5. Click **"Enable workflow"**.
6. Click **"Run workflow"**.
7. Enjoy! üéâ

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: It might take a couple of seconds until your new README appears! üòä

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Remove keys to exclude them from your README.

  ],
  "additional_info": "", // some additional information you can provide :)
